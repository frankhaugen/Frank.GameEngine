# Frank.GameEngine

This has had many iterations, and has periodically been developed, or tried to be developed using AI tools like ChatGpt,
but now I scrapped that and started over going bottom up.

The intention is to create a game engine that can be used to create games independent of platform and rendering
technology. The engine will be able to run on any platform that can run .NET 5.0 or later, and will be able to use any
rendering technology, so in this game engine you are only relying on the BCL and the rendering technology you choose to
use, so there is a decoupling between the game engine and the rendering technology.

How useable this will be is yet to be seen, but the intention is to make it as useable as possible, and to make it as
easy as possible to create games using this engine as nuget packages in your project.
